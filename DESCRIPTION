Description: moongraphics is a graph building package that helps to keep your code clean and organized, 
  specially when working with ggplot2 graphs, that tend to make your code repetitive and extensive.
  By wrapping all necessary graph logics into one simple function, moongraphics allows for users to easily create graphs with the 
  standard built-in theme that are aesthetically pleasing, without needing to worry about remembering all the ggplot2 syntax 
  to do that.
